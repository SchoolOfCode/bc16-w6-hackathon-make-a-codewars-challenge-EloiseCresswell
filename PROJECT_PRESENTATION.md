//PLANNING STAGE

1. Come up with an idea ✅

- Idea is Monthly Dog Toy Cost

Dreamer

- Have lots of different attributes to a dog
- Include multiple dogs/different types of pets!
- Work out the cost of each pet therefore individually

Realist

- Likely to be difficult to have multiple pets and may become complex for the user

Critic

- Likely to confuse the user
- May run out of time to complete
- Stick simple and add complexity if time allows
- Remember, I understand my Kata because it is in my head, think about other people's understanding of what I write/instructions.

MVP1:

- Function which takes in an array containing 2 numbers and a string and returns a string. ✅
- Test the function with Vitest to check it is working using TDD approach. ✅
- Create a kata description ✅
  See this jam board for further detail https://jamboard.google.com/d/1MyuUcj8szgu60FB7zdGt6VJepWAFEB5ADviME_Lpc8c/edit?usp=sharing

MVP2:

- Aded complexity to MVP1 - this time, the 'dog' can earn money that money by making money through sticks
  ✅

Goal 1

- set up : complete Vitest set up ✅
  Goal 2
- complete Kata scenario in main.Js ✅
  Goal 3
- Write 5 simple tests based on JamBoard above - conditions for this test are outlined in the jamboard above. ✅
  Goal 4

  Goal 5
- Share my Kata
  Goal 6: (MVP 2)
- Add further complexity to the test, adding the case for when my dog makes money for me ✅
  Goal 7:
- Check tests for MVP2 ✅
  Goal 8:
- Share my Kata
  Goal 9: (MVP 3)
- Add further complexity to the test, adding in another further item (socks) ✅
  Goal 10:
- Check tests for MVP3 ✅
  Goal 11:
- Share my Kata

// REFLECTIONS - TEAMWORK

- our team was FAB this week, supporting each other and helping each other through all of our difficulties
- We had a open and honest communication style focusing on building each other up and motivating one another with regular check-ins
  // - FINAL RESULT
- Overall, I am pleased with my Kata, although simple I think it makes sense and should be fun to do!
- If I had more time: I would have liked to have added a second pet and had their individual costs
