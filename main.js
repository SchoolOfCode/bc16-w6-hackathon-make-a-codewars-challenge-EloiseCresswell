/**
 * Hello ther challenger! Your task is to write a function named `dogMonthlyCost` which takes in an array and returns the cost of the dog based on how many items it needs and returns a string with the name of the dog and the cost of their toys that month.
 *
 * The array
 * ['item1', numberofItem1, 'item2', numberofItem2, 'name of dog']
 *
 * Cost of some of the items...
 * - a stick will actually bring you money! (You get £5 per whole stick!)
 * - a ball will cost you 20p to purchase
 *
 *
 * A few examples:
 *    `dogMonthlyCost(['sticks', 2 , 'balls', 100, 'Ivy'])` should return "My dog Ivy has 2 sticks, 100 balls. This month she has cost me £10"
 *    `dogMonthlyCost(['sticks', 0, 'balls', 50, 'Steve'])` should return "My dog Steve has 0 sticks, 50 balls. This month she has cost me £10"
 */
export function dogMonthlyCost(array) {
  // Good luck!
  return "My dog Ivy has 2 sticks, 100 balls. This month she has cost me £10";
}
